# CS-320-JUNIT-Testing

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Creating JUNIT tests that offer coverage for the most vital functions of the 
program aim to make it as secure as possible. Addressing critical components 
first, the functional components are stress tested against as many possible
failures that may occur. Doing so, this can ensure the validity of the program
and system.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs can be translated into functional requirements, and handling
exceptions within these needs, such as memory constraints, will work
towards delivering a program that is sound and provides what the user
is requesting. Testing these needs is intrinsic to the overall performance
and reliability of the program and providing these needs.

How do I approach designing software?

Designing software comes from organizing functional and nonfunctional requirements
and how they might translate into actual code. Creating UML's for each process, psuedo code,
and prototype software can help outline what works and what does not, as well as reveal
if there are additional needs and requirements that were otherwise not included.
Creating JUNIT tests as design and development is undertaken, helps to eliminate larger and
more cumbersome tests and problems within the system. Testing in batches with the addition of
each new function can also be streamlined using automation tools, working towards efficient 
testing protocols and allowing the larger and more delicate functions of a program be
the main focus.
